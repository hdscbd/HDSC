## B. CONFIDENTIALITY OF A RESEARCH STUDY
Confidentiality refers to how information is handled and maintained in a trusting relationship with the presumption that it will not be revealed to others in ways that are inconsistent with the original disclosure (the consent form) without permission. Confidential information about human subjects in a research sample may include, but is not limited to, the following:
- Name, date of birth, age, sex, address, and contact information;
- Current contact details of family, guardian, etc.;
- Medical or educational history and/or records;
- Personal care issues;
- Sexual lifestyle;
- Ethnic or racial origin;
- Service records and progress notes;
