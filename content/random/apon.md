## About Apon

Apon is a non-profit blood donation platform lead by Health Data Research Organization. Primarily Apon is dedicated to Thalassemia patients. As we know, Thalassemia patients need 1-2 bags of blood every month. It's challenging to manage this amount of blood of their own. But if we work together, it will be easier for them. That's why Apon comes in.

Previously, we managed donors by calling them on demand. It's not only for Thalassemia patients but also for all critical patients. But why is Apon dedicated to Thalassemia now?
There are many blood donation organizations out there that contribute a lot. In a critical moment, they managed blood for patients selflessly. That's why Apon is dedicated to thalassemia patients in Bangladesh.

According to Bangladesh Thalassemia Foundation, 7% of our population are thalassemia carriers, and every year 7000 new babies are born with Thalassemia in Bangladesh. Unfortunately, this number can be more extensive in the future. If we want to serve this large number of patients, we need to develop an organized website or mobile app that helps. However, Bangladesh Thalassemia Foundation has a registration portal(https://www.thals.org/blood/register_donor#/)  to manage donors. We are trying to build an Android App for helping thalassemia patients. By using this app, they can manage donors location-wise easily. Initially, we work for Dhaka City. After that, we will extend our activity at the district level one by one.
We need to aware of this public health problem of the Country. Bangladesh Thalassemia Foundation says, "Thalassemia is a preventable disease. The disease only occurs when both the parents carry the thalassemia gene. In such families, the probability of having a thalassemia-affected baby in each pregnancy is 25%. However, if either partner is healthy, children will not be affected at all."
