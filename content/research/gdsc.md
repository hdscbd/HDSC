Genomic Data Science Center is a research wing of the CHIRAL Bangladesh. The wing focuses on using publicly available genomic data to understand the cause of diseases, the transmission of conditions, and the evolutionary relationship among multiple organisms. The GDSC team also uses genomic epidemiology to understand the community transmission of viruses such as COVID-19, Dengue, and Chikungunya.

### Aims
- To use publicly available genomic data for understanding the cause of diseases.
- To improve the healthcare system in Bangladesh through the understanding of the genome.
- To enable data science for making data-driven conclusions and help policymakers to make decisions.

## Workflow and Tools

This section is a starter's guide for students or researchers who want to research undergraduate and graduate levels with Genomic Data Science Center. Here is our research area, approach, the tools that we use. If you have any questions, please send us an email at **chiralbd.org@gmail.com**


### Slack

{{< figure src="/img/starter-guide/slack-logo.png" width="100px"
class="left-inline" >}}

Ideas are usually discussed in a [slack](https://slack.com/) chatroom. Slack stores a record of the chats so our discussions are automatically documented for later use, such as getting newcomers in the team up to speed.

<br />

### Git and Github

{{< figure src="/img/starter-guide/Octocat.jpg" width="100px" class="left-inline" >}}

 We use the [git](http://git-scm.com) version control system to track the various developments of our code base and we organize our projects in repositories at [github](http://github.com). It is important to become a smooth user of both git and github. We use git and github also to track all documents that we write ourselves, including your thesis report. In the windows environment, I recommend that you install [github for windows](http://windows.github.com/) and/or [TortoiseGit](http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/).  [Github bootcamp](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) and Dudler's [git guide](http://rogerdudler.github.com/git-guide/) are good places to start. Our workflow is loosely based on [github flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html). The articles on [Team collaboration with github](http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/general/team-collaboration-with-github/) and [How to collaborate on Github](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-collaborate-on-github--net-34267) also contain interesting discussions.


### Nextstrain

{{< figure src="/img/starter-guide/nextstrain.png" width="100px" class="left-inline" >}}

[Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/) is a collaboration between researchers in Seattle, USA, and Basel, Switzerland, which provides a collection of open-source tools for visualizing the genetics behind the spread of viral outbreaks. GDSC uses this tool to visualize genomic data.

### Biopython

{{< figure src="/img/starter-guide/biopython.png" width="120px" class="left-inline" >}}

The [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) project is an open-source collection of non-commercial Python tools for computational biology and bioinformatics, created by an international association of developers.

<br>

### Bioconductor

{{< figure src="/img/starter-guide/bioconductor.png" width="100px" class="left-inline" >}}

[Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) is a free, open source and open development software project for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data generated by wet lab experiments in molecular biology. Bioconductor is based primarily on the statistical R programming language, but does contain contributions in other programming languages.

<br>

### Julia

{{< figure src="/img/starter-guide/julia-logo.png" width="120px" class="left-inline" >}}

[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language. While it is a general-purpose language and can be used to write any application, many of its features are well suited for numerical analysis and computational science.

<br>

### LaTeX

{{< figure src="/img/starter-guide/latex-logo.png" width="100px" class="left-inline" >}}
The project's final report should be written in [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). You must get familiar with LaTeX early during your project, because we start writing the final report very soon after the start of the project.
