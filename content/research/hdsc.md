CHIRAL Bangladesh deals with genomics and public research; the Health Data Science Center(HDSC) is dedicated to public health. The CPHR team focuses on the public health problems in Bangladesh. The design study for generating data for CHIRAL and preprocess the secondary data to give an insightful shape.



### The Challenges
According to [worldometers.info](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/bangladesh-population/), Bangladesh, with a population of 166,275,884 million in 2021, is a country in South Asia. Bangladesh is one of the world's most densely populated countries, with a population density of 1265 people per $km^2$. In South-East Asia the main public health issues are infectious diseases and communicable diseases. Public health has improved markedly in Bangladesh over the past several decades. Nevertheless, Bangladesh faces major health challenges.Bangladesh is faced a number of health problems, which can be classified as follows:

- Population problems
- Communicable diseases problems
- Nutritional problems
- Environmental sanitation problems
- Health problems

### Aims
- To conduct health surveys for understanding the current public health problems.
- To use health data in multiple forms to understand the cause of diseases and improve people's lives.
- We are working to help policymakers to make data-driven decisions by using raw data.

### Mission
{{< figure src="/img/starter-guide/public_health.jpg" width="450px" class="right-inline" >}}

We will empower data science to transform public health research by linking it to sources of data beyond the healthcare services, along with other government sectors, organizations, and data on health-related environments. While those who work in these fields may not view their data as having a direct impact on public health, decisions made in education, housing, technology, engineering, law, fiscal policy, environmental science, planning, history, and behavioral sciences all have an effect on our health.

## Workflow and Tools

This section is a starter's guide for students or researchers who want to research undergraduate and graduate levels with Genomic Data Science Center. Here is our research area, approach, the tools that we use. If you have any questions, please send us an email at **chiralbd.org@gmail.com**


### Git and Github

{{< figure src="/img/starter-guide/Octocat.jpg" width="100px" class="left-inline" >}}

 We use the [git](http://git-scm.com) version control system to track the various developments of our code base and we organize our projects in repositories at [github](http://github.com). It is important to become a smooth user of both git and github. We use git and github also to track all documents that we write ourselves, including your thesis report. In the windows environment, I recommend that you install [github for windows](http://windows.github.com/) and/or [TortoiseGit](http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/).  [Github bootcamp](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) and Dudler's [git guide](http://rogerdudler.github.com/git-guide/) are good places to start. Our workflow is loosely based on [github flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html). The articles on [Team collaboration with github](http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/general/team-collaboration-with-github/) and [How to collaborate on Github](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-collaborate-on-github--net-34267) also contain interesting discussions.


### Python

{{< figure src="/img/starter-guide/python.png" width="120px" class="left-inline" >}}
We use [Julia](http://julialang.org/) as our main programming language. You are probably used to MATLAB and may be put off by the idea of having to learn another language. Don't worry, Julia is more-or-less an open source MATLAB variant, but much faster (within 2x speed of C) and much cooler than MATLAB. It is a very promising language for data science in general and it will help your research work a lot if you become proficient in Julia.

### R Programming

I also recommend that you spend some time on getting familiar with [Test-Driven Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=11&v=ZB66AKW87M0) (TDD) of code.

### LaTeX

{{< figure src="/img/starter-guide/latex-logo.png" width="120px" class="left-inline" >}}

The project's final report should be written in [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). You must get familiar with LaTeX early during your project, because we start writing the final report very soon after the start of the project.


### Mendeley

{{< figure src="/img/starter-guide/mendeley.png" width="100px" class="left-inline" >}}

After you join the BIASlab team you will also get access to our literature collection that we store online in a  [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) repository. This will help you get an overview of all relevant papers in our field.
