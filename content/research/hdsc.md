## Who We are
CHIRAL Bangladesh stands for Center for Health Innovation, Research, Action and Learning - Bangladesh (CHIRAL Bangladesh). We are a voluntary non-profit research organization, resolving to promote interdisciplinary research in the field of health data science, computational biology and genomics. Health Data Science Center(HDSC) is a research wing of CHIRAL Bangladesh, focuses on solving health problems using data science and machine learning.

## What We Do
We collaborate with a broad variety of partners, including patients, the general public, physicians, researchers, and health organizations, to assist them in conducting research into the causes, prevention, and treatment of all health problems using health data (such as heart attacks, strokes, and vascular dementia). We do this to make sure that new ways to treat and care for diseases and health problems reach patients as quickly as possible.

## Our Aims
- Create a center of interdisciplinary expertise that provides national research capability in health data science.
- Form strong and long-lasting partnerships with Bangladesh's national healthcare system, incorporating health research expertise from across the country and serving as a Bangladesh-wide resource to support numerous future studies involving electronic health records (EHRs) linked to a variety of other multi-dimensional health datasets.
- Through collaboration with the HDSC and other entities, engage patients, the public, and practitioners to offer a transparent and publically acceptable approach to the governance of health data research within the health research domain.
- Create and develop international collaborations that allow Bangladesh's health research community to participate in, contribute to, and lead data-driven health research on a global scale.


## Our Working Areas 
- Structured Data
- Unstructured Data
- Personal Monitoring Data
- Clinical Trials


## Mission
{{< figure src="/img/starter-guide/public_health.jpg" width="450px" class="right-inline" >}}

We will empower data science to transform public health research by linking it to sources of data beyond the healthcare services, along with other government sectors, organizations, and data on health-related environments. While those who work in these fields may not view their data as having a direct impact on public health, decisions made in education, housing, technology, engineering, law, fiscal policy, environmental science, planning, history, and behavioral sciences all have an effect on our health.




## Workflow and Tools

This section is a starter's guide for students or researchers who want to research undergraduate and graduate levels with Genomic Data Science Center. Here is our research area, approach, the tools that we use. If you have any questions, please send us an email at **chiralbd.org@gmail.com**


### Git and Github

{{< figure src="/img/starter-guide/Octocat.jpg" width="100px" class="left-inline" >}}

 We use the [git](http://git-scm.com) version control system to track the various developments of our code base and we organize our projects in repositories at [github](http://github.com). It is important to become a smooth user of both git and github. We use git and github also to track all documents that we write ourselves, including your thesis report. In the windows environment, I recommend that you install [github for windows](http://windows.github.com/) and/or [TortoiseGit](http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/).  [Github bootcamp](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) and Dudler's [git guide](http://rogerdudler.github.com/git-guide/) are good places to start. Our workflow is loosely based on [github flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html). The articles on [Team collaboration with github](http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/general/team-collaboration-with-github/) and [How to collaborate on Github](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-collaborate-on-github--net-34267) also contain interesting discussions.


### Python

{{< figure src="/img/starter-guide/python.png" width="120px" class="left-inline" >}}
We use [Julia](http://julialang.org/) as our main programming language. You are probably used to MATLAB and may be put off by the idea of having to learn another language. Don't worry, Julia is more-or-less an open source MATLAB variant, but much faster (within 2x speed of C) and much cooler than MATLAB. It is a very promising language for data science in general and it will help your research work a lot if you become proficient in Julia.

### R Programming

I also recommend that you spend some time on getting familiar with [Test-Driven Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=11&v=ZB66AKW87M0) (TDD) of code.

### LaTeX

{{< figure src="/img/starter-guide/latex-logo.png" width="120px" class="left-inline" >}}

The project's final report should be written in [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). You must get familiar with LaTeX early during your project, because we start writing the final report very soon after the start of the project.


### Mendeley

{{< figure src="/img/starter-guide/mendeley.png" width="100px" class="left-inline" >}}

After you join the BIASlab team you will also get access to our literature collection that we store online in a  [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) repository. This will help you get an overview of all relevant papers in our field.
