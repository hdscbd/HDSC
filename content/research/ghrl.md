A geographic information system (GIS) is a computer-based tool for mapping and analyzing feature events on earth. Remote sensing is the art and science of making measurements of the globe using sensors on airplanes or satellites.

In today’s increasingly data-driven healthcare systems, gathering accurate information for analysis is a high priority. Doctors and nurses want to know as much as they can about the factors that affect each patient’s care. At the same time, administrators and public health leaders need to watch population-level trends and maintain regulatory acquiescence. Spatial data can be indispensable in achieving all these goals, making geographic information science (GIS) essential for public health research and strategy.

The GHRL team focus on the publicly available data, and they turn data into knowledge. We also enable Geological Survey to collect data from the community level.

### Aims
- To track the sources of diseases and the progress of diseases, agencies can respond more effectively to disease outbreaks by identifying at-risk populations and targeting interventions.
- To mapping and analyzing biodiversity data, such as the distribution of species or other 'point-distributions.'
- To enable geo-spatial data science for making data-driven conclusions and help policymakers to make decisions.
- To understand the distribution of the environmental pollutants using satellite imagery technology

## GIS Software

### [DIVA-GIS](http://diva-gis.org/)
DIVA-GIS is a free computer program for mapping and geographic data analysis (a geographic information system (GIS). With DIVA-GIS you can make maps of the world, or of a very small area, using, for example, state boundaries, rivers, a satellite image, and the locations of sites where an animal species was observed. We also provide free spatial data for the whole world that you can use in DIVA-GIS or other programs.
