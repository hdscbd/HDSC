I am a Microbiology student at Jagannath University .I am
interested and working with Health data science, bioinformatics, public
health. I am a member of the Health Data Research Organization as well.
The Health Data Research Organization (HDRO) is a non-profit
organization dedicated to scientific research and dissemination using
primary and secondary sources as well as third-party data. Students and
young professionals with expertise in biological science and health
science run the organization, which is supervised by university faculty
members in the life sciences.

I know C++. I also have a limited understanding of R programming and
microsoft work.


Python is my go-to language for data mining and machine learning. I also have a limited understanding of R and SQL.
