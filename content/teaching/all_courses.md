The Center for Health Innovation, Research, Action and Learning - Bangladesh (CHIRAL Bangladesh) runs different programs regarding health data analytics, bioinformatics, genomic data science. The aim of these programs to develop a community on scientific computing in the field of health science. The courses are free, and some are paid. The course fees of these courses will spend on our research.


## Health Data Science Training Modules 
Health data analytics, also known as clinical data analytics, involves the extrapolation of actionable insights from sets of patient data, typically collected from electronic health records (EHRs).The growing need is spurred by the recent major challenge of population health management (PHM), widely seen as the most effective approach to improving healthcare delivery among diverse groups of people while lowering costs to providers. Posing difficulties to PHM and the data mining involved is an ever-expanding patient base, compounded by the addition of new patients under the Affordable Care Act and the shift toward new payment models that it requires.

## GIS and Remote Sensing in Public Health
Geographic information systems (GIS) are computer-based tools for storing, visualizing, analyzing, and interpreting geographic data. These data include anything that can be linked to a geographic location or, more simply, anything that can be mapped. Spatial data includes, but is not limited to, disease cases, hospitals, roads, waterways, country boundaries, and health catchment areas. Typically, data in a GIS contain attributes, or descriptive information. For instance, you may have a data set of hospitals in the United States that you can map.
