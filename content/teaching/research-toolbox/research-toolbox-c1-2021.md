### Learning Objectives
- Understanding of the basic programming concept using Python in the health research perspective
- Understanding of the essential health data analysis workflow
- How to import and clean data using Pandas(A data management package built with Python)
- How to formulate a research question
- How to analyze health data
- How to visualize data using Matplotlib and seaborn(Data visualization packages built with Python)
- How to analyze and visualize geospatial data using Geopandas(A Python package to work with geospatial data)
- Understanding and interpreting data using descriptive statistics with Python
- Understanding and interpreting data using inferential statistics with Python
- Building and evaluating regressing model using scikit-learn(A machine learning library built with Python)
- Building and evaluating classification model using scikit-learn(A machine learning library built with Python)

### Aims
- Provides fundamentals of programming concepts through Python programming language.
- Provides a solid understanding of data analysis workflow in the field of health sciences(i.e. public health, health data science, genomic data science)
- We aim to develop thought processes and guide the learners to develop their analyst mindset, which is essential to becoming a successful health data analyst or researcher.

### Who this course is for
- If you have no programming experience but want to learn the necessary concepts in health research- then this is the right place for you to begin with.
- If you have no data analysis experience but want learn end-to-end data analysis process from data collection to report writing- then this course is a great one to start.
- If you have some experience but are not confident enough to start your project, you can start from here.
- If you are an undergrad student and planning to start your research journey, this course will surely also help you.

### Course Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites, and we do not assume any prior background in computer programming or statistics. Students should, however, have installed Python and Jupyter Notebook, and worked through a basic tutorial on Python Environment Setup.
