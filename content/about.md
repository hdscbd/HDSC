# Health Data Science Center, CHIRAL Bangladesh

## Who We are
CHIRAL Bangladesh stands for Center for Health Innovation, Research, Action and Learning - Bangladesh (CHIRAL Bangladesh). We are a voluntary non-profit research organization, resolving to promote interdisciplinary research in the field of health data science, computational biology and genomics. Health Data Science Center(HDSC) is a research wing of CHIRAL Bangladesh, focuses on solving health problems using data science and machine learning.

## What We Do
We collaborate with a broad variety of partners, including patients, the general public, physicians, researchers, and health organizations, to assist them in conducting research into the causes, prevention, and treatment of all health problems using health data (such as heart attacks, strokes, and vascular dementia). We do this to make sure that new ways to treat and care for diseases and health problems reach patients as quickly as possible.

## Our Aims
- Create a center of interdisciplinary expertise that provides national research capability in health data science.
- Form strong and long-lasting partnerships with Bangladesh's national healthcare system, incorporating health research expertise from across the country and serving as a Bangladesh-wide resource to support numerous future studies involving electronic health records (EHRs) linked to a variety of other multi-dimensional health datasets.
- Through collaboration with the HDSC and other entities, engage patients, the public, and practitioners to offer a transparent and publically acceptable approach to the governance of health data research within the health research domain.
- Create and develop international collaborations that allow Bangladesh's health research community to participate in, contribute to, and lead data-driven health research on a global scale.
