### The Challenges
According to [worldometers.info](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/bangladesh-population/), Bangladesh, with a population of 166,275,884 million in 2021, is a country in South Asia. Bangladesh is one of the world's most densely populated countries, with a population density of 1265 people per $km^2$. In South-East Asia the main public health issues are infectious diseases and communicable diseases. Public health has improved markedly in Bangladesh over the past several decades. Nevertheless, Bangladesh faces major health challenges.Bangladesh is faced a number of health problems, which can be classified as follows:

- Population problems
- Communicable diseases problems
- Nutritional problems
- Environmental sanitation problems
- Health problems

### Aims
- To conduct health surveys for understanding the current public health problems.
- To use health data in multiple forms to understand the cause of diseases and improve people's lives.
- We are working to help policymakers to make data-driven decisions by using raw data.

### Mission
s
We will empower data science to transform public health research by linking it to sources of data beyond the healthcare services, along with other government sectors, organizations, and data on health-related environments. While those who work in these fields may not view their data as having a direct impact on public health, decisions made in education, housing, technology, engineering, law, fiscal policy, environmental science, planning, history, and behavioral sciences all have an effect on our health.
