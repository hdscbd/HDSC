Suicide is a serious public health problem; however, suicides are preventable with timely, evidence-based and often low-cost interventions. For national responses to be effective, a comprehensive multisectoral suicide prevention strategy is needed(Source: [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/suicide))

## Objectives of SAP
- Establish effective, sustainable, and collaborative suicide prevention programming at the country,
regional, and local levels.
- Develop and sustain public-private partnerships to advance suicide prevention, including
schools, workplaces and faith-based communities.
- Implement research-informed communication efforts designed to prevent suicide by
changing knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors.
- Increase knowledge of the factors that offer protection from suicidal behaviors and that
promote wellness and recovery.
- Promote responsible media reporting of suicide.

## Key Research Questions
- Question 1: Why do people become suicidal?
- Question 2: How can we better or more optimally detect/predict risk?
- Question 3: What interventions prevent individuals from engaging in suicidal behavior?
- Question 4: What services are most effective for treating the suicidal person and preventing suicidal behavior?
- Question 5: What other types of interventions (outside health care settings) reduce suicide risk?
- Question 6: What new and existing research infrastructure is needed to reduce suicidal behavior?


## Global Suicide Statistics
- More than 700 000 people die due to suicide every year.
- For every suicide there are many more people who attempt suicide. A prior suicide attempt is the single most important risk factor for suicide in the general population.
- Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death in 15-19-year-olds.
77% of global suicides occur in low- and middle-income countries.
- Ingestion of pesticide, hanging and firearms are among the most common methods of suicide globally. <br>
