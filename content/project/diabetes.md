short_description = "Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease that is characterized by elevated blood glucose (or blood sugar) levels. Over time, diabetes can cause serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. The most common type of diabetes, which typically affects adults, occurs when the body develops resistance to insulin or produces insufficient insulin."
description = "Diabetes mellitus is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in Bangladesh, where healthcare facilities and accessibility are inadequate. Diabetes is also linked to heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. The secret to achieving clinical goals in ambulatory treatment is assumed to be sufficient patient awareness of self-care. In Bangladesh, there are a few studies on the relationship between awareness and self-care practices among type 2 diabetes patients, but none are recent. Despite this, little research has been done on type 1 diabetes patients' self-care habits and awareness.The foundation of DM management is diabetes education combined with adequate motivation of patients and caregivers."
