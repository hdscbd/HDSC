## Project Description
School health refers to the comprehensive efforts of developing, implementing, and evaluating services both within and outside of the school that provide each and every student with the resources needed to thrive in a healthy environment.

CHIRAL Bangladesh is committed to improving the quality of teens and school health through health research in Bangladesh. The School Health is an initiative by CHIRAL Bangladesh with some dedicated public health research enthusiasts. This project's primary goal is to promote teen health by linking schools, health organizations, and the community.

## Background
The use of a systematic instrument or procedure to identify students' strengths and needs is known as school mental health screening. Screening is done for all students, not only those who have been identified as being at risk for or already experiencing mental health issues. This might include screening a complete population, such as the student body at a school, or a smaller subset of a population, such as a certain grade level.

Mental health screening is most typically used to identify individual students who are having or are at risk of experiencing social, emotional, and/or behavioral disorders. The use of screening as an early detection approach detects the beginnings of problems early on, allowing them to be addressed before they worsen.

Screening measures can also ask students about:
- Indicators of well-being and positive mental health
- Life satisfaction
- School belonging
- Social determinants of mental health
- Adverse early life experiences

## Importance of Screening

Given the high prevalence and recurrence of mental health disorders, and the availability of effective treatments, it is important to identify problems early and connect students to services and supports. Schools are a critical setting for screening, consistent with the public health framework to improve population health of all students and families.

## Purposes of Screening
-  Identify students at risk for poor outcomes
-  Identify students who may need monitoring or intervention (i.e., secondary or tertiary)
- Inform decisions about needed services
- Identify personal strengths/wellness as well as risk factors/emotional distress
-  Assess effectiveness of universal social/emotional/behavioral curriculum

## Why Screening?

## Purpose of School Health
The purpose of the CHIRAL Bangladesh Adolescence and School Health project is to improve student learning by modifying or removing health-related barriers to learning and promoting optimal health and wellbeing. In order to help students reach their full potential, the project will encourage collaboration among school health program personnel, students, parents/guardians, educators, staff members, and other community resources. The Adolescence and School Health project is intended to ensure that procedures for those who become ill or injured at school are in place. The Adolescence and School Health project is not intended to replace the health care that parents/guardians should provide for their children. When necessary, parents/guardians should be encouraged to seek the services of private/public physicians, dentists, optometrists, and other community health agencies.

## Goal
The goal of the CHIRAL Bangladesh Adolescence and School Health project is to help each child achieve and maintain optimum health to ensure physical, emotional, and intellectual growth.

## Objectives
- To identify health problems which may interfere with the childâ€™s performance in school.
- The school will distribute Health Assessment survey forms to students and parents at kindergarten registration.
- To assist in the prevention of communicable disease.
- To provide a comprehensive health education program to all school-age children.


## Confidentiality of Health Information in Schools
The Helsinki Declaration was followed by the CHIRAL Bangladesh. Student health information, both written and verbal, is kept strictly confidential. The information should only be shared with those who can help the student's educational process by understanding an underlying health problem.
