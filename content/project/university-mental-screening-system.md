## Background
The screening of students to identify whether they are at risk for a mental health problem is known as mental health screening. Screening can be done with a whole population, such as a university's student body, or with a subset of students, such as a classroom or grade level, utilizing a systematic instrument or method (s). This is not the same as employing assessment measures with individuals who have previously been recognized as being at risk for or suffering from mental health disorders. However, implementing a systematic assessment approach with referred or enrolled students is also great practice; some of the material in this guide may also be used for initial evaluation or progress monitoring.
