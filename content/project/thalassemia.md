##

Thalassemia is a hereditary blood disorder that affects children and causes severe anemia. Each month, these patients require 1-2 bags of blood. Thalassemia is extremely prevalent in Bangladesh. 7% of our population is thalassemia positive, and 7000 new babies are born with thalassemia each year in Bangladesh. This disease is easily preventable with the right information and awareness.


## Aims

- Create a strong partnership with different thalassemia hospitals in Bangladesh that provides national research capability in public health.
- Engage with patients, the public, and practitioners through partnership hospitals and other bodies to deliver an acceptable approach to prevent thalassemia.
- Create a "Thalassemia Prevention Programme" at different universities in Bangladesh.
- To improve the quality of life of thalassemic children and their parents.

## Approach
The Health Data Research Organization works to create the **"Thalassemia Prevention Programme."** at different universities in Bangladesh. Currently, we are generating data about knowledge, attitude, and awareness towards thalassemia. Initially, We are working on the practice and knowledge towards thalassemia among public university students.

## Working Papers
1. [Knowledge and Attitudes of Thalassemia among Public University Students in Bangladesh](#)
2. [Quality of Life among Bangladeshi Patients with Thalassemia using the SF-36 Questionnaire](#) [Proposed]


## Principal Investigator(PI)
[Dr. Mohammad Ariful Islam](https://chiralbd.netlify.app/member/ariful_islam/)
## Co-Principal Investigator(Co-PI)
[Bangladesh Thalassemia Foundation](https://thals.org/)



## On Going Survey: Declaration
This survey focuses on the knowledge, attitude, and awareness of students from different public universities of Bangladesh towards Thalassemia. Your kind participation in this survey will help our research.This survey is expected to be spontaneous. You are requested to fill the given questions based on your
won knowledge. All the information collected for this survey is highly confidential and will be used for research purpose only.

## The initiative from Health Data Research Organization
{{< figure src="/img/projects/apon/apon.png" width="450px" class="right-inline" >}}

**Apon** is a non-profit blood donation platform lead by [Health Data Research Organization](https://hdrobd.org/). Primarily Apon is dedicated to Thalassemia patients. As we know, Thalassemia patients need 1-2 bags of blood every month. It is challenging to manage this amount of blood of their own. However, if we work together, it will be easier for them. That is why Apon comes in.

Previously, we managed donors by calling them on demand. It is not only for Thalassemia patients but also for all critical patients. However, why is Apon dedicated to Thalassemia now? There are many blood donation organizations out there that contribute a lot. In a critical moment, they managed blood for patients selflessly. That is why Apon is dedicated to thalassemia patients in Bangladesh.

However, Bangladesh Thalassemia Foundation has a [registration porta](https://www.thals.org/blood/register_donor#/) to manage donors. We are trying to build an Android App for helping thalassemia patients. By using this app, they can manage donors location-wise easily. Initially, we work for Dhaka City. After that, we will extend our activities at the district level one by one.
