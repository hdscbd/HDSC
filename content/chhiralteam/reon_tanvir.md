I am a Microbiology BSc. student at Jagannath
University and a Health Data Science and Genomic Data Science enthusiast. Health Data Science, Bioinformatics, Public Health Genomic
Data, Microbiology are some of my research interests. I am an Undergraduate Researcher of  the Health Data Research Organization as well.

The Health Data Research Organization (HDRO) is a non-profit organization dedicated to scientific research and dissemination using primary and secondary sources as well as third-party data. Students and young professionals with expertise in biological science and health science run the organization, which is supervised by university faculty members in the life sciences.

R is my go-to language for Data Mining and Statistical Data Analysis. I also have a limited understanding of SPSS.
