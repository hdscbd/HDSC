I am a Microbiology Honour’s student at Jagann ath University.Health data
science, bioinformatics, public health are some of my research interests. I am
a member of the Health Data Research Organization as well.
The Health Data Research Organization (HDRO) is a non-profit organization
dedicated to scientific research and dissemination using primary and
secondary sources as well as third-party data.
I have a little experiences on python so python is my go-to language for data
mining and machine learning.
