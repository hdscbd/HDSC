At this moment I am a Microbiology Honour’s student at Jagannath
University and a Health Data Science enthusiast. Health data science,
public health are some of my research interests. I am working as a
member of the Health Data Research Organization as well.
As far I know The Health Data Research Organization (HDRO) is a non-
profit organization dedicated to scientific research and dissemination
using primary and secondary sources.
I’m trying to learn new programming language as I can contribute my
hard work in HDRO.
