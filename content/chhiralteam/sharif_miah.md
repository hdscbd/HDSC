I am doing BSC in Microbiology at Jagannath University.  Public health is my research interest. I am a research assistant in Health Data Research Organization.
The Health Data Research Organization (HDRO) is a non-profit organization dedicated to scientific research and dissemination using primary and secondary sources as well as third-party data. Students and young professionals with expertise in biological science and health science run the organization, which is supervised by university faculty members in the life sciences.
